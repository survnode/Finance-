# Currency strength

An MQL4 indicator showing the overall strength ranking of the 8 major currencies on a scale of 7 to -7

The ranking is based on the direction of the 28 major currency pairs for each bar. Each currency has an identifying
color and line style changes from dash to solid when the currency is part of the underlying currency pair in the main
window. All these settings are customizable.
